                    <h6>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</h6>

                    <p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
                        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
                        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
                        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
                        Contributor:</p>

                    <p>a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or</p>

                    <h6>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h6>

                    <p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

                        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if

                    <h6>2.5. Representation</h6>

                    <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
                        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
                        grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>

                    <h6>2.6. Fair Use</h6>

                    <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under

                    <h6>3. Responsibilities</h6>

                    <h6>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h6>

                    <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
                        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
                        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
                        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
                        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
                        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
                        Form.</p>

                    <h6>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</h6>

                    <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>

                    <p>a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
                        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
                        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
                        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
                        of distribution to the recipient; and</p>

                    <p>b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
                        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
                        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
                        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>

                    <h6>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h6>

                    <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
                        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
                        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
                        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
                        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
                        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
                        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
                        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
                        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
                        License(s).</p>

                    <h6>3.4. Notices</h6>

                    <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
                        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
                        limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
                        Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
                        extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>

                    <h6>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h6>

                    <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
                        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
                        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
                        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
                        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
                        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
                        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
                        jurisdiction.</p>

                    <h6>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h6>

                    <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
                        with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
                        judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
                        this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                        limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
                        text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
                        this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
                        such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
                        skill to be able to understand it.</p>

                    <h6>5. Termination</h6>

                    <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
                        fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
                        then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
                        are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
                        explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
                        basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
                        some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
                        compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
                        reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
                        non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
                        received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
                        Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
                        of the notice.</p>

                    <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
                        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
                        counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
                        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
                        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section

                        validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to

                    <h6>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h6>

                    <p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
                        without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
                        including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
                        of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
                        The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
                        is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
                        You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
                        repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
                        part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under
                        this License except under this disclaimer.</p>

                    <h6>7. Limitation of Liability</h6>

                    <p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
                        negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
                        distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
                        direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
                        character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
                        goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
                        informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
                        shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
                        such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
                        limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                        incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
                        not apply to You.</p>

                    <h6>8. Litigation</h6>

                    <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
                        of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
                        business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
                        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
                        in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
                        counter-claims.</p>

                    <h6>9. Miscellaneous</h6>

                    <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
                        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
                        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
                        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
                        the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
                        be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>


                    <h6>10. Versions of the License</h6>

                    <h6>10.1. New Versions</h6>

                    <p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
                        10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

                        distinguishing version number.</p>

                        of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
                        or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
                        steward.

                    <h6>10.3. Modified Versions</h6>

                    <p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
                        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
                        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
                        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
                        such modified license differs from this License).</p>

                      of or in connection with the use or performance of this software.</p>

                    <p>A large portion of the dictionary entries
                      originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
                      Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.</p>

                    <p>Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
                      original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
                      that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
                      on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
                      in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
                      distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
                      contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
                      jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.</p>

                    <p>NO WARRANTY</p>

                    <p>The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
                      research and development conducted during the project and is provided
                      to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
                      program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
                      implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
                      includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
                      performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
                      the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
                      any right of any third party.</p>

                    <p>Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
                      have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
                      the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
                      otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
                      organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
                      development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
                      officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
                      damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
                      and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
                      with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
                      or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
                      regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
                      knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
                      project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
                      foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
                      "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
                      modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
                      production of secondary products from the program.
                </p>
                    <p>In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
                      modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
                      any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
                      grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
                      writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
                      from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
                      above as far as the program is concerned.</p>

                    <p>5. Time Zone Database</p>

                    <p>ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
                    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
                    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
                    Database section 7.</p>

                    <p>7.  Database Ownership</p>

                    <p>The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
                        document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
                        that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
                        public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
                        not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
                        to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
                        Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
                        Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
                        understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
                        with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
                        by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
                        making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
                        future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

                    <p>Preamble</p>

                    <p>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
                    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
                    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
                    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
                    Package available as open source and free software.</p>

                    <p>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
                    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
                    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
                    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
                    a different licensing arrangement.</p>

                    <p> Definitions</p>

                    <p>"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
                    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.</p>

                    <p>"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
                    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
                    procedures.</p>

                    <p>"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
                    distribute, or modify the Package.</p>

                    <p>"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
                    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
                    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
                    Version, or a Modified Version.</p>

                    <p>"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
                    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
                    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.</p>

                    <p>"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
                    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
                    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.</p>

                    <p>"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
                    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
                    by the Copyright Holder.</p>

                    <p>"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
                    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
                    Holder.</p>

                    <p>"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
                    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
                    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.</p>

                    <p>"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
                    configuration files for the Package.</p>

                    <p>"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
                    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
                    translation of the Source form.</p>

                    <p>Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution</p>

                    <p>(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
                    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
                    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.</p>

                    <p>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version</p>

                    <p>(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
                    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
                    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
                    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
                    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
                    Compiled form of the Package.</p>

                    <p>(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
                    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
                    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
                    will be subject to the Original License.</p>

                    <p>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source</p>

                    <p>(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
                    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
                    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
                    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
                    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
                    you do at least ONE of the following:</p>

                    <p>(a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
                    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
                    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
                    Version.</p>

                    <p>(b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
                    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
                    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
                    from the name of the Standard Version.</p>

                    <p>(c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
                    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
                    under</p>

                    <p>(i)  the Original License or</p>

                    <p>(ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
                    modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
                    licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
                    received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
                    Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
                    available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
                    Fees are allowed.</p>

                    <p> Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
                    or Modified Versions without the Source</p>

                    <p>(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
                    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
                    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
                    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
                    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
                    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
                    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
                    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
                    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.</p>

                    <p>(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
                    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
                    the Source of the Modified Version.</p>

                    <p>Aggregating or Linking the Package</p>

                    <p>(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
                    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
                    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
                    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
                    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
                    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
                    as included in the aggregation.</p>

                    <p>(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
                    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
                    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
                    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
                    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.</p>

                    <p>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version</p>

                    <p>(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
                    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
                    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
                    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
                    terms of this license.</p>

                    <p> General Provisions</p>

                    <p>(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
                    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
                    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
                    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
                    license.</p>

                    <p>(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
                    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
                    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
                    this license.</p>

                    <p>(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
                    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.</p>

                    <p>(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
                    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
                    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
                    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
                    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
                    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
                    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
                    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
                    date that such litigation is filed.</p>

                    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS

                    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
